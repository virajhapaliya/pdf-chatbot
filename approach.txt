Questions
1. What is the average profit margin of all companies? 
2. which company has best and worst profit margin ?
3. Rate the companies based on its profit margin 


APPROACH
1. To solve this problem approch would be identifing the intent of the user query and if it has logical intent like average, max ,min etc then implement a single query based LLM flow where we extract the query in large mode and ask the llm again to give response. 

2. Another approch could be this. Llama index have different new feature where one feature is multidocument agents. Where they provide different functionality.

    This can be usefull in our current problem.
